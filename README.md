## AlgoExpert LeetCode Solutions

Here I am storing all the solutions I come up with to problems I solve on AlgoExpert.io and Leetcode.com.

All these solutions have passed the test cases on AlgoExpert / LeetCode, and I have noted down the time and space complexities as well.

I'm using Python3 and C++ to solve these problems.
Python3 as it avoids a lot of boilerplate code, and also has many data structures and functionalities like sorting, array max etc built in.
C++ because it's useful for the gaming industry, and also helps provide a better understanding of memory use. 

#TO DO

I will be working on creating a tabular summary of the all the problems solved, as well as adding more structure to the LeetCode solutions added
